      "510120":"A laboratory test is performed to measure total or direct bilirubin. Bilirubin is a pigmented waste product normally produced when red blood cells (RBCs) break down. Non-water soluble (unconjugated) bilirubin is carried on albumin to the liver where it attaches to sugar molecules to become conjugated. Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is water soluble and able to pass from the liver to the small intestine. Further breakdown of bilirubin occurs in the small intestine and it is eventually eliminated in the feces in the form of stercobilin. Total bilirubin is the sum of conjugated (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin. A test for either conjugated or direct bilirubin (82248) or total bilirubin (82247) may be ordered to diagnose and monitor liver disorders, hemolytic anemia, and newborn (physiologic) jaundice. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture or heel stick. Other body fluids, including cerebral spinal fluid, may be collected and tested for total bilirubin. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.", "510121":"A laboratory test is performed to measure total or direct bilirubin.

A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture or heel stick. Other body fluids, including cerebral spinal fluid, may be collected and tested for total bilirubin. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.",
      "510130":"A blood sample is taken to measure the amount of total calcium. Calcium is one of the most important minerals in the body. About 99 percent of the calcium found the body is stored in the bones. The remaining one percent circulates in the blood. Calcium may be ionized (free) or attached (bound) to proteins. Free calcium is the calcium metabolically active in the body. Bound calcium is inactive. Total calcium is a measurement of the total amount of both free calcium and bound calcium circulating in the blood. Total calcium is measured to screen for or monitor a number of conditions, including those affecting the bones, heart, nerves, kidneys and teeth. Total calcium is measured using spectrophotometry.",
      "510135":"A blood sample is taken to measure the total carbon dioxide (CO2) level. The total CO2 level is composed of CO2, bicarbonate (HCO3-), and carbonic acid (H2CO3), with the primary constituent being bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is a negatively charged electrolyte that works in conjunction with other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and chloride, to maintain proper acid-base balance and electrical neutrality at the cellular level. Bicarbonate is excreted and reabsorbed by the kidneys. Total CO2 gives a rough estimate of bicarbonate concentration in the blood. CO2 is measured by enzymatic methodology.",
      "510145":"A blood sample is taken to measure chloride level. Chloride is a negatively charged electrolyte that works in conjunction with other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and carbon dioxide (CO2), to regulate fluid in the body and maintain proper acid-base balance. Chloride is found in all body fluids, but is concentrated in the blood. Chloride levels mirror sodium levels, increasing and decreasing in direct relationship to sodium, except when there is an acid-base imbalance. When an acid-base imbalance occurs, chloride acts as a buffer and chloride levels move independently of sodium. Chloride is measured to screen for or monitor electrolyte or acid-base balance. Chloride is measured by ion-selective electrode (ISE) methodology.",
      "510160":"A blood sample is taken to measure creatinine levels. Creatinine is a waste product produced by the muscles in the breakdown of creatine, which is a compound used by the muscles to create energy for contraction. The waste product, creatinine, is excreted by the kidneys and blood levels provide a good measurement of renal function. Creatinine may be checked to screen for or monitor treatment of renal disease. Creatinine levels may also be monitored in patients with acute or chronic illnesses that may impair renal function and in patients on medications that affect renal function. Creatinine is measured using spectrophotometry.",
      "510175":"A blood sample is obtained to measure total (quantitative) blood glucose level. Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose, absorbed by the intestine, and circulated in the blood. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, regulates glucose level in the blood and transports glucose to cells in other tissues and organs. When more glucose is available in the blood than is required, it is converted to glycogen and stored in the liver or converted to fat and stored in adipose (fat) tissue. If the glucose/insulin metabolic process is working properly, blood glucose will remain at a fairly constant, healthy level. Glucose is measured to determine whether the glucose/insulin metabolic process is functioning properly. It is used to monitor glucose levels and determine whether they are too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia) as well as test for diabetes and monitor blood sugar control in diabetics. Use 82947 for quantitative blood glucose determination by enzymatic methodology or any method other than reagent strip. Use 82948 for blood glucose determination by reagent strip. A drop of blood is placed on a reagent strip, which is then compared to a calibrated color scale and a visual determination is made as to the amount of glucose present in the specimen.",
      "510220":"A blood test is performed to measure alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. ALP is a hydrolase enzyme that removes the phosphate group from molecules and is found abundantly in the liver, bile ducts, kidney, bone and placenta. Elevated levels may be associated with bile duct obstruction, Paget's disease and seminomas. Levels may be decreased in hypophosphatasia (an autosomal recessive genetic disease), Wilson's disease, certain types of anemia/leukemia, in postmenopausal women on estrogen therapy for osteoporosis and in women taking oral contraceptives, in men following cardiac surgery and with malnutrition or hypothyroidism, and in children with achondroplasia, cretinism or severe enteritis. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. In 84075, total alkaline phosphatase is measured. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative enzymatic methodology. In 84078, heat stable alkaline phosphatase is measured. Placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP or Regan isoenzyme) has been identified as the most heat stable. In 84080, alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme levels are measured. Isoenzymes are classified as ALPI (intestine), ALPL (non-specific, liver/bone/kidney) and ALPP (placental). Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative heat inactivation/enzymatic technique.",
      "510225":"A blood or urine test is performed to measure inorganic phosphorus (phosphate) levels. Phosphate is an intracellular anion, found primarily in bone and soft tissue. It plays an important role in cellular energy (nerve and muscle function) and the building/repair of bone and teeth. Decreased levels are most often caused by malnutrition and lead to muscle and neurological dysfunction. Elevated levels may be due to kidney or parathyroid gland problems. In 84100, a blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry. In 84105, a 24-hour or random urine sample is obtained. Urine is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.",
      "510230":"A blood sample is obtained to measure potassium level. Potassium is a positively charged electrolyte that works in conjunction with other electrolytes, such as sodium, chloride, and carbon dioxide (CO2), to regulate body fluid, stimulate muscle contraction, and maintain proper acid-base balance. Potassium is found in all body fluids but mostly stored within cells, not in extracellular fluids, blood serum, or plasma. Small fluctuations in blood potassium, either too high (hyperkalemia) or too low (hypokalemia), can have serious, even life-threatening, consequences. Potassium level is used to screen for and monitor renal disease; monitor patients on certain medications, such as diuretics, as well as patients with acute and chronic conditions, such as dehydration or endocrine disorders. Because blood potassium affects heart rhythm and respiratory rate, it is routinely checked prior to major surgical procedures. Potassium is measured by ion-selective electrode (ISE) methodology.",
      "510235":"A blood test is performed to measure total protein levels. Total protein is often reported as a ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G ratio), and normal results will show albumin slightly greater than globulin. The test may be used to monitor nutritional status or diagnose kidney and liver disease. Elevated levels can indicate chronic inflammation, viral hepatitis, HIV infection, and multiple myeloma. Levels that are decreased may result from malnutrition or malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum, plasma, or whole blood may be tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.",
      "510241":"A blood test is performed to measure albumin levels in serum, plasma, or whole blood. Albumin is a plasma protein responsible for regulating the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. It is capable of binding water, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin, and drugs/medications. Albumin levels are used to assess nutritional status. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. The plasma, serum or whole blood is tested using spectrophotometry or quantitative nephelometry.",
      "510245":"A blood sample is obtained to measure sodium level in 84295. A urine sample is obtained to measure sodium level in 84300. A sample other than urine, blood, plasma, or serum is obtained to measure sodium level in 84302. Sodium is a positively charged electrolyte that works in conjunction with other electrolytes, such as potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide (CO2), to regulate fluid in the body and maintain proper acid-base balance. Sodium is an essential mineral in the body, necessary for maintaining normal metabolic processes, fluid levels, and vascular pressure. Sodium level is used to screen for and monitor elevated blood sodium (hypernatremia), low blood sodium (hyponatremia), and electrolyte imbalances. Sodium may be monitored in patients on certain medications, such as diuretics, that can cause electrolyte imbalance. Sodium is measured by ion-selective electrode (ISE) methodology.",
      "510260":"A blood test is performed to measure aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. This enzyme was previously referred to as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). AST is an enzyme found primarily in liver and muscle cells. Elevated levels may result from liver disease or damage such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, ischemia, drug toxicity, and/or muscle damage, especially cardiac muscle (myocardial infarction). This test is often ordered in conjunction with alanine transferase, ALT (84460) or other liver function tests (LFTs) to diagnose disease and monitor individuals taking cholesterol lowering medications. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative enzymatic method.",
      "510261":"A blood test is performed to measure alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. This enzyme was previously referred to as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). ALT is an enzyme found primarily in liver and muscle cells. Elevated levels may result from liver disease or damage such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, ischemia, drug toxicity, and/or muscle damage, especially cardiac muscle (myocardial infarction). This test is often ordered in conjunction with aspartate transferase, AST (84450) or other liver function tests (LFTs) to diagnose disease and monitor individuals taking cholesterol lowering medications. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative enzymatic method.",
      "510285":"A blood sample is obtained to measure total (quantitative) urea nitrogen (BUN) level. Urea is a waste product produced in the liver by the breakdown of protein from a sequence of chemical reactions referred to as the urea or Krebs-Henseleit cycle. Urea then enters the bloodstream, is taken up by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Blood BUN is measured to evaluate renal function, to monitor patients with renal disease, and to evaluate effectiveness of dialysis. BUN may also be measured in patients with acute or chronic illnesses that affect renal function. BUN is measured using spectrophotometry.",
      "510290":"A blood test is performed to measure uric acid levels. Uric acid forms from the natural breakdown of body cells and the food we ingest. Uric acid is normally filtered by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Elevated blood levels may result from kidney disease, certain cancers and/or cancer therapies, hemolytic or sickle cell anemia, heart failure, cirrhosis, lead poisoning, and low levels of thyroid or parathyroid hormones. Levels may be decreased in Wilson's disease, poor dietary intake of protein, and with the use of certain drugs. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.",
      "510675":"A urinalysis is performed by dip stick or tablet reagent for bilirubin, glucose, hemoglobin, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, protein, specific gravity, and/or urobilinogen. Urinalysis can quickly screen for conditions that do not immediately produce symptoms such as diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, or urinary tract infection. A dip stick allows qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis using a paper or plastic stick with color strips for each agent being tested. The stick is dipped in the urine specimen and the color strips are then compared to a color chart to determine the presence or absence and/or a rough estimate of the concentration of each agent tested. Reagent tablets use an absorbent mat with a few drops of urine placed on the mat followed by a reagent tablet. A drop of distilled, deionized water is then placed on the tablet and the color change is observed. Bilirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells by the liver. Normally bilirubin is excreted through the bowel, but in patients with liver disease, bilirubin is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Glucose is a sugar that is normally filtered by the glomerulus and excreted only in small quantities in the urine. Excess sugar in the urine (glycosuria) is indicative of diabetes mellitus. The peroxidase activity of erythrocytes is used to detect hemoglobin in the urine which may be indicative of hematuria, myoglobinuria, or hemoglobinuria. Ketones in the urine are the result of diabetic ketoacidosis or calorie deprivation (starvation). A leukocyte esterase test identifies the presence of white blood cells in the urine. The presence of nitrites in the urine is indicative of bacteria. The pH identifies the acid-base levels in the urine. The presence of excessive amounts of protein (proteinuria) may be indicative of nephrotic syndrome. Specific gravity measures urine density and is indicative of the kidneys' ability to concentrate and dilute urine. Following dip stick or reagent testing, the urine sample may be examined under a microscope. The urine sample is placed in a test tube and centrifuged. The sediment is resuspended. A drop of the resuspended sediment is then placed on a glass slide, cover-slipped, and examined under a microscope for crystals, casts, squamous cells, blood (white, red) cells, and bacteria. Use 81000 for a non-automated test with microscopy and 81001 for an automated test with microscopy. Use 81002 for a non-automated test without microscopy and 81003 for an automated test without microscopy.",
      "510830":"A blood or body fluid test is performed to measure lactate dehydrogenase (LD) (LDH) levels. LDH is an enzyme present in red blood cells (RBCs) and in the tissue of heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain and lungs. LDH levels are used as a marker for tissue and RBC damage. Elevated blood levels can be caused by stroke, myocardial infarction, liver disease, pancreatitis, muscular dystrophy, infectious mononucleosis, hemolytic anemia and tumors/cancers such as lymphoma. Elevated cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels are usually indicative of bacterial meningitis. LDH levels in pleural and/or pericardial fluid can indicate if the effusion is an exudate, caused by an infection or a transudate caused by fluid pressure problem. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Cerebral spinal fluid is obtained by separately reportable lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Pericardial fluid is obtained by separately reportable pericardiocentesis. Fluid from a pleural effusion is obtained by separately reportable thoracentesis. Serum or plasma and all body fluids are tested using quantitative enzymatic methodology.",
      "510845":"A blood, urine, or fecal test is performed to measure magnesium levels. Magnesium is an essential dietary mineral responsible for enzyme function, energy production, and contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers. Decreased levels may result from severe burns, metabolic disorders, certain medications, and low blood calcium levels. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Red blood cells (RBCs) are tested using quantitative inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Serum/plasma is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry. A 24-hour voided urine specimen is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry. A random or 24-hour fecal sample is tested using quantitative spectrophotometry.",
      "520783":"FREE T4",
      "520834":"Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid hormone) produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress. The hormone causes an elevation in blood glucose levels, a decrease in immune system function and aids in the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. The test may be used to diagnose Cushing syndrome (elevated cortisol levels) or Addison disease (decreased cortisol levels). In 82530, a urine test is performed to measure free cortisol (hydrocortisone) levels. A 24 hour or random urine sample is collected by separately reportable procedure. Urine is tested using quantitative liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry. In 82533, a blood or saliva test is performed to measure total cortisol (hydrocortisone) levels. A blood sample is obtained by separately reportable venipuncture. Serum or plasma is tested using quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay or quantitative liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry. A saliva sample is obtained by separately reportable oral swab using a saliva collection device. Saliva is tested using quantitative enzyme immunoassay.",
      "520869":"A blood test is performed to determine levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is produced in the pituitary and helps to regulate two other thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4), which in turn help regulate the body's metabolic processes. TSH levels are tested to determine whether the thyroid is functioning properly. Patients with symptoms of weight gain, tiredness, dry skin, constipation, or menstrual irregularities may have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Patients with symptoms of weight loss, rapid heart rate, nervousness, diarrhea, feeling of being too hot, or menstrual irregularities may have an overactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). TSH levels are also periodically tested in individuals on thyroid medications. The test is performed by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.",
      "540310":"An automated complete blood count (CBC) is performed with or without automated differential white blood cell (WBC) count. A CBC is used as a screening test to evaluate overall health and symptoms such as fatigue, bruising, bleeding, and inflammation, or to help diagnose infection. A CBC includes measurement of hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count with or without differential, and platelet count. Hgb measures the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood. Hct refers to the volume of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a given volume of blood and is usually expressed as a percentage of total blood volume. RBC count is the number of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a specific volume of blood. WBC count is the number of white blood cells (leukocytes) in a specific volume of blood. There are five types of WBCs: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. If a differential is performed, each of the five types is counted separately. Platelet count is the number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood. Platelets are responsible for blood clotting. The CBC is performed with an automated blood cell counting instrument that can also be programmed to provide an automated WBC differential count. Use 85025 for CBC with automated differential WBC count or 85027 for CBC without differential WBC count.",
      "540376":"This test may also be referred to as an activated PTT or aPTT. PTT may be performed to diagnose the cause of bleeding or as a screening test prior to surgery to rule-out coagulation defects. A silica and synthetic phospholipid PTT reagent is mixed with the patient plasma. The silica provides a negatively-charged particulate surface that activates the contact pathway for coagulation. Clot formation is initiated by adding calcium chloride to the mixture. Clotting time is measured photo-optically. If PTT is elevated and the patient is not on a blood thinning medication, a second PTT using substitution plasma fractions (85732), also referred to as a PTT mixing study, may be performed. This is performed by mixing patient plasma with normal plasma using a 1:1 mix. The mixture is incubated and the clotting time is again measured. If the result does not correct, it may be indicative that the patient has an inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant. If the result does correct, the patient may have a coagulation factor deficiency. Code 85732 is reported for each PTT mixing study performed.",
      "540385":"Prothrombin time (PT) measures how long it takes for blood to clot. Prothrombin, also called factor II, is one of the clotting factors made by the liver and adequate levels of vitamin K are needed for the liver to produce sufficient prothrombin. Prothrombin time is used to help identify the cause of abnormal bleeding or bruising; to check whether blood thinning medication, such as warfarin (Coumadin), is working; to check for low levels of blood clotting factors I, II, V, VII, and X; to check for low levels of vitamin K; to check liver function, to see how quickly the body is using up its clotting factors. The test is performed using electromagnetic mechanical clot detection. If prothrombin time is elevated and the patient is not on a blood thinning medication, a second prothrombin time using substitution plasma fractions (85611), also referred to as a prothrombin time mixing study, may be performed. This is performed by mixing patient plasma with normal plasma using a 1:1 mix. The mixture is incubated and the clotting time is again measured. If the result does not correct, it may be indicative that the patient has an inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant. If the result does correct, the patient may have a coagulation factor deficiency. Code 85611 is reported for each prothrombin time mixing study performed.",
      "1524898":"In 3615, an appropriate vein is selected, usually one of the larger anecubital veins such as the median cubital, basilic, or cehalic veins. A tourniquet is placed above the planned puncture site. The site is disinfected with an alcohol pad. A needle is attached to a hub and the vein is punctured. A Vacuainer tube is attached to the hub and the blood specimen is collected. The Vacutainer tube is removed. Depending on the specific blood tests required, multiple Vacutainers may be filled from the same punchture site. In 36416, a blood sample is obtained by capillary puncture usually performed on the fingertip, ear lobe, heel or toe. Heel and toe sites are typically used only on neonates and infants. The planned puncture site is cleaned with an alcohol pad. A lancet is used to puncture the skin. A drop of blood is allowed to form at the puncture site and is then touched with a capillary tube to collect the specimen.",
      "1940222":"A radiologic examination of the chest is performed. Chest radiographs (X-rays) provide images of the heart, lungs, bronchi, major blood vessels (aorta, vena cava, pulmonary vessels), and bones, (sternum, ribs, clavicle, scapula, spine). In 71020, two views, frontal and lateral, are obtained. The patient is positioned facing the X-ray machine for the frontal view and then turned with the side of the chest positioned in front for the lateral view. A small burst of radiation is delivered for each X-ray and the images are recorded on hard copy film or stored electronically as digital images. In 71021, frontal and lateral images are obtained as described above along with an apical lordotic view that provides better visualization of the apical (top) regions of the lungs. The patient is positioned with the back arched so that the tops of the lungs can be X-rayed. In 71022, frontal and lateral images are obtained with oblique projections, which may be obtained to evaluate a pulmonary or mediastinal mass or opacity or to provide additional images of the heart and great vessels. There are four positions used for oblique views: right and left anterior oblique, and right and left posterior oblique. Anterior oblique views are obtained with the patient standing and the chest rotated 45 degrees. The arm closest to the X-ray cassette is flexed with the hand resting on the hip. The opposite arm is raised as high as possible. The part of the chest farthest away from the X-ray cassette is the area being studied. Posterior oblique views are typically obtained only when the patient is too ill to stand or lay prone for anterior oblique views. In 71023, frontal and lateral views are obtained with fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy is performed to evaluate motion and function of chest structures including the lungs, diaphragm, and other structures of the respiratory tract. A continuous X-ray beam is passed through the chest, transmitted to a monitor, and the motion of chest structures is studied in detail.",

     "9294206":"An ECG is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart. The test is performed with the patient lying prone on the exam table. Small plastic patches are attached at specific locations on the chest, abdomen, arms, and/or legs. Leads (wires) from the ECG tracing device are then attached to the patches. A tracing is obtained of the electrical signals from the heart. Electrical activity begins in the sinoatrial node which generates an electrical stimulus at regular intervals, usually 60 to 100 times per minute. This stimulus travels through the conduction pathways to the sinoatrial node causing the atria to contract. The stimulus then travels along the bundle of His which divides into right and left pathways providing electrical stimulation of the ventricles causing them to contract. Each contraction of the ventricles represents one heart beat. The ECG tracing includes the following elements: P wave, QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave. The P wave, a small upward notch in the tracing, indicates electrical stimulation of the atria. This is followed by the QRS complex which indicates the ventricles are electrically stimulated to contract. The short flat ST segment follows and indicates the time between the end of the ventricular contraction and the T wave. The T wave represents the recovery period of the ventricles. The physician reviews, interprets, and provides a written report of the ECG recording taking care to note any abnormalities. Use 93000 to report the complete procedure, including ECG tracing with physician review, interpretation, and report; use 93005 to report the tracing only; and use 93010 to report physician interpretation and written report only.",
      "8763280":"A programming evaluation is performed on a pacemaker device with iterative adjustment of the implantable device, testing its function and selecting optimal permanent programmed values, including physician or other qualified health care professional analysis and review with a written report. The patient is connected to the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. A connection is established between the pacemaker device and the programming device. Cardiac rhythm is assessed. Stored pacemaker data is interrogated, reviewed, and compared with previous data acquisitions. Pacemaker function is assessed, including the leads and battery. Summary data and recorded rhythm data are reviewed for evidence of arrhythmias. Rhythm alerts and parameters are noted; pacing capture threshold is measured; and voltage and pulse width parameters are reviewed. The sensing threshold is measured and adjusted as needed. Exercise and physiologic stress data is reviewed; heart rate adaptations are noted; and programmed parameters are adjusted as needed. Any necessary reprogramming of the device is performed after careful evaluation of all parameters. The patient is given instructions regarding any required follow-up services or procedures.

      "510160":"A blood sample is taken to measure creatinine levels. Creatinine is a waste product produced by the muscles in the breakdown of creatine, which is a compound used by the muscles to create energy for contraction. The waste product, creatinine, is excreted by the kidneys and blood levels provide a good measurement of renal function. Creatinine may be checked to screen for or monitor treatment of renal disease. Creatinine levels may also be monitored in patients with acute or chronic illnesses that may impair renal function and in patients on medications that affect renal function. Creatinine is measured using spectrophotometry.",
      "510285":"A blood sample is obtained to measure total (quantitative) urea nitrogen (BUN) level. Urea is a waste product produced in the liver by the breakdown of protein from a sequence of chemical reactions referred to as the urea or Krebs-Henseleit cycle. Urea then enters the bloodstream, is taken up by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Blood BUN is measured to evaluate renal function, to monitor patients with renal disease, and to evaluate effectiveness of dialysis. BUN may also be measured in patients with acute or chronic illnesses that affect renal function. BUN is measured using spectrophotometry.",
      "515012":"The level of the natriuretic peptide in the blood is measured to evaluate heart failure and to differentiate symptoms that might be indicative of heart failure from other disorders that cause similar symptoms. A separately reportable venipuncture is performed and whole blood or plasma collected using EDTA as an anticoagulant. An automated immunoassay is performed using murine monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against natriuretic peptide. The antibodies are labeled with a fluorescent dye and immobilized on the solid phase. The specimen is placed in the sample chamber and the analysis is run. The physician reviews the results and uses them to make diagnosis and treatment decisions.",
      "3710081":"An indirect antihuman globulin (Coombs) test is done to detect clinically significant antibodies in the blood. Some red cells are coated with complement or IgG antibodies and do not agglutinate when centrifuged. This is also referred to as IgG or complement sensitization. Another antibody that reacts with the IgG or complement must be introduced to allow agglutination to occur. Indirect antihuman globulin tests are performed on in vitro specimens. The specimen is incubated at 37 degrees Centigrade, allowing the antibodies in the serum to react with the cells in vitro. The cells are then washed and an antiglobulin reagent is used to detect antibody coating of the cells. The cells are centrifuged and the test is read. Use 86885 for qualitative testing performed on each reagent red cell. Red cell antigen testing involves using the patient's red cells plus a reagent antiserum. The patient's cells are the unknown antigen and the reagent antiserum is the known antibody. The patient's blood is tested to determine the presence of clinically significant antibodies, usually prior to a blood transfusion. The qualitative test will determine the presence of antibodies but not the quantity of antibodies. If antibodies are detected, other tests will be performed to identify the specific antibody(s). Report 86885 for each reagent red cell test to identify antibodies. Use 86886 for each antibody titer. An antibody identified on a previous test is analyzed to determine the strength or potency of the antibody. Report 86886 for each antibody titer performed.",

      "3711992":"A laboratory test is performed to determine the donor-recipient compatibility of a unit of blood. Compatibility testing may also be referred to as cross matching (CM). Immediate spin technique (ISCM) (86920) mixes recipient plasma or serum with donor red cells, centrifuges them immediately, and observes any hemolysis and/or agglutination. ISCM will not detect all ABO incompatibilities; however, a negative result indicates the blood of the donor and recipient are compatible and the unit may be transfused. The antiglobulin technique (86922) is performed when a patient’s antibody screening test is positive or there is a history of a clinically significant antibody, i.e., one that has caused a condition such as acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. The antiglobulin technique can detect non-agglutinating red cell antibodies (indirect antiglobulin test, IAT), or sensitized red cells (direct antiglobulin test, DAT) by mixing a reagent containing monoclonal antibodies (Coombs reagent) directed against IgG and C3 (which indirectly reacts with IgM autoantibodies) and observing for agglutination (clumping). Incubation technique (86921) warms the patient red cells to 37°C for 30 minutes and observes for agglutination. A positive IAT is most likely to occur in patients with warm IgG autoantibodies. A positive DAT is most commonly associated with cold IgM autoantibodies. The electronic compatibility test (86923) involves no mixing of recipient and donor samples and follows a precise algorithm using a computer software system to determine compatibility. The recipient must have a negative antibody history and the current blood sample must be antibody negative with no active RBC atypical antibodies. Patient ABO/Rh information is entered twice by 2 different technicians. The donor unit is bar coded and the code is scanned into the computer. The computer verifies the donor unit for ABO/Rh and determines compatibility."}
